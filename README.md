# 🎓💀 ExPillaites: Where College Dreams Come to Network

Welcome to ExPillaites, the social network that proves your college years were just the beginning of your lifelong descent into corporate purgatory!

## 🕸️ What is ExPillaites?

ExPillaites is the result of a caffeine-fueled, sleep-deprived hackathon. It's like LinkedIn, but with more existential dread and fewer "inspirational" posts about how your education made you a millionaire by 25.

### Features:

- **Post**: Share your "success" stories and watch as your former classmates pretend to care.
- **Comment**: Offer "constructive" feedback on others' life choices while questioning your own degree.
- **Share**: Spread the misery! Because if college taught you anything, it's that misery loves company.
- **Education Experiences**: Relive your academic trauma and realize how little it prepared you for the real world.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone this repository (just like you clone your successful classmates' life choices)
2. Install dependencies (npm install existential-crisis)
3. Run `npm start` and watch as your computer questions its education

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Frontend: React (because we love hooking ourselves to endless cycles of updates, just like the curriculum)
- Backend: Node.js (as unstable as your post-grad career path)
- Database: MongoDB (where dreams are stored and never queried again)
- Authentication: JWT (Just Wishing for Trust)

## 🤝 Contributing

Think you can make this digital purgatory better? We doubt it, but we're too tired to stop you. Fork the repo, make your changes, and submit a PR. We'll review it right after we finish updating our own resumes.

Remember, in ExPillaites, every connection is just another reminder of the friends you used to have before you all became corporate drones. Happy Networking, ExPillaites! 🥳🔗⚰️
