# The "Your-Degree-Won't-Make-You-Rich-Anyway" License (YDWMYRA)

Version 1.0, September 2024

Copyright (c) 2024 ExPillaites Team

## Preamble

This license is as useful as your college degree, which is to say, it's mostly for show. But since we live in a world of formalities, here's a bunch of legal-sounding stuff that you'll probably ignore, just like you did with your college textbooks.

## Terms and Conditions

1. **Definitions**
   - "The Software" refers to ExPillaites, which is about as stable as your first job out of college.
   - "You" refers to anyone brave or foolish enough to use this software, much like attending college in the first place.

2. **Grant of Rights**
   You are hereby granted the right to use, copy, modify, and distribute The Software, provided that:
   a) You acknowledge that this software is about as reliable as your college roommate's alarm clock.
   b) You accept that using this software may result in flashbacks to late-night cramming sessions and questionable life choices.

3. **Restrictions**
   You may not use The Software to:
   a) Pretend you're more successful than you actually are (that's what Instagram is for).
   b) Escape the existential dread of post-graduate life.
   c) Actually make money (let's be realistic here).

4. **Disclaimer of Warranty**
   The Software is provided "as is", without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. In no event shall the authors or copyright holders be liable for any claim, damages, or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort or otherwise, arising from, out of or in connection with The Software or the use or other dealings in The Software. In other words, if this breaks, you get to keep both pieces.

5. **Limitation of Liability**
   In no event shall the authors be liable for any damages whatsoever, including but not limited to emotional distress caused by reliving college memories, loss of imaginary internet points, or general disillusionment with the state of social networking.

6. **Acceptance**
   By using The Software, you accept that your college years are over and it's all downhill from here. You also accept this license, because let's face it, you didn't read the terms of service for anything else either.

7. **Termination**
   This license terminates automatically if you find actual success using this software. But let's be honest, what are the odds of that?

## Conclusion

This license is about as binding as the promise you made to "stay in touch" with your college friends. Use The Software, have fun, and remember: it's not about the destination, it's about the crippling student debt you accumulated along the way.
